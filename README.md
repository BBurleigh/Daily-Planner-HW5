# Daily-Planner-HW5

## Description
Aside from practicing more JS coding skills and and jQuery, this schedule was created using table rows.  The JS allows the user to target text added into each hour's row and then save it to local storage.  Should the person reload the page, the information will be pulled from local storage and placed back on the page.  In addition, each hour's row is color-coded to display which hours have past, which hour is the present, and the future hours.  The colors respectively are gray (past), red (present), and green (future).

## Installation

## Usage
In theory, if I was someone who needed a basic online hourly planner that went by each day, then I would use this to keep track of what I was doing from 7 AM to 7 PM.

## Credits
Aside from my instructor and TA, my tutor aided me in adjusting and fixing the save button so that text inputted into the text area would remain after the page was reloaded. A person from AskBCSLearner helped refine one part of my code with the use of an each() to color the table rows based on time. In addition, online resources such as w3school.com were helpful.
